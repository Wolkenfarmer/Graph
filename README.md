# Graph
A little program for building and displaying graphs. <br />
I wanted to create a UI and work with java lists in a computer science lesson - so I did in Christmas holidays. <br />

<br />

New nodes and relations can be added through the ui above the listviews. Already existing nodes and relations can be reviewed in the listviews and deleted. 
The pointing direction of the relation can even edited after creation in the corresponding listview.
After setting up your graph it can be displayed adjacency matrix or graphic circle by selecting the wanted display format and pressing "compute" afterwards.

### Currently not under active development

## Made only for the learning experience and fun - you run graph at your own risk!
