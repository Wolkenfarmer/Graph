# Graph
A little program for building and displaying graphs. <br />
I wanted to create a UI and work with java lists in a computer science lesson - therefore I did it on my school vacation. :D<br />

<br />

## Navigation
New nodes and relations can be added through the UI above the listviews by entering either the name or selecting two different nodes and entering a weight and pressing add. Already existing nodes and relations can be reviewed in the listviews and deleted by pressing the corresponding button or set to inactive (these will not be displayed and relations with them will be gray in the relation's listview) by ticking the corresponding box off. 
The pointing direction of the relation can be edited after it's creation in the corresponding listview by pressing on the arrows.
After setting up your graph it can be displayed as an adjacency matrix or a graphic circle by selecting the wanted display format and pressing "compute" afterwards. <br />

## Controls
- Esc -> Closes the program.
- scroll -> Moves the content up and down, if it exceeds the program's size.
- click -> Buttons and stuff.. self-explanatory.

## Software requirements
Uses Java 10 library.<br>
However, the releases package it's own Java hence for only running the program you don't need java.<br>
For compiling on other devices the classpath probabaly has to be fixed.

### Currently not under active development

## Made only for learning and fun - you run Graph at your own risk!
